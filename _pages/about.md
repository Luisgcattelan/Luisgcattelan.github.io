Hi! My name is Luís Gustavo Prates Cattelan. I’m in my senior year of a bachelor’s degree in Physics. I’m interested in Environmental Science and its transdisciplinary branches. Currently, I am an undergraduate research intern in the field of Earth System Science, focused on understanding tropical ecosystems resilience.

Besides the research, I worked in outreach and science communication projects. I also did some research in History of Physics. I founded with colleagues the ‘Grupo de Física Computacional’ (GFC) at UFRGS. The objective of this collective is to strengthen a community of undergraduate students interested in Computational Physics.
I won an Erasmus+ scholarship to study a semester (09/21 - 02/22) in Sapienza University of Rome. I attended coursers from the Masters program in Artificial Intelligence.

Regarding my future, after I reach my Bachelor’s Degree I intend to continue to research, perhaps in a post-graduate program. My goal is to use concepts from Statistical Physics and Data Science to help understand how our world as a whole works.
Personal Interests include: cycling, trekking and enjoying my city at its fullest.
